# April Tags testing

### Some demo stuff I did to work out april tags

They're pretty promising since you can get a lot of data from them pretty easily.

1. Print out the large tag and the checkerboard in images
2. Take a bunch of pictures of the checkboard with your camera and put them in calibration_images
3. Run `calibrate.py` first and get your camera matrix.
4. Run `index.py` and hold up the apriltag you printed
